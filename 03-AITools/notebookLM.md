NotebookLM is an AI-powered note-taking application developed by Google that helps users organize, summarize, and extract insights from various information sources. It enables users to upload documents, videos, and other content, transforming them into interactive, AI-generated podcasts.

While NotebookLM initially gained attention for its audio podcast feature, which allows you to upload material and generate podcast-style audio, what we truly love about it is the ability to chat with your documents. While ChatGPT also offers an upload file option, NotebookLM's implementation is much more efficient, allowing you to upload up to 50 different sources, including websites, YouTube videos, PDFs, and more. It’s an amazing tool to upload content and simply ask questions. This feature will be especially useful for reading and analyzing papers in this course!

**Key Features:**
**Less Hallucination:** NotebookLM is incredibly useful when you need accurate, factual outputs with minimal hallucination, especially when working with information scattered across various sources and formats. It excels at transforming fragmented information into a cohesive output.

**Efficient Sourcing and Referencing:** It can quickly and efficiently source references from multiple materials, connect relevant points, and generate a well-rounded output in significantly less time than other tools.

**Accuracy vs. Creativity:** NotebookLM is fine-tuned to reduce hallucinations, making it reliable for factual work. However, it tends to be less creative than models like ChatGPT, which are optimized for speed and creativity but prone to hallucination.

**How to Use NotebookLM:**
Access the Platform: Go to the [NotebookLM website] (https://notebooklm.google.com/and) sign in with your Google account.

Create a New Notebook: Click on "Create New Notebook" and give it a relevant name.

Upload Sources: Add up to 50 sources, including documents, PDFs, YouTube videos, and other types of accessible content.

Interact with Your Notebook: Use the AI to ask questions, generate summaries, or create podcasts based on the uploaded content.

Try to play around with it! We'll be using NotebookLM to analyze research papers throughout the course.
