# 🧠 Understanding Deep Learning, Neural Networks & LLM Architecture

## Overview
To understand how **LLMs** work, it's important to first grasp **neural networks** and **deep learning**, which in turn require a solid foundation in **machine learning**.

> While deep knowledge isn’t required for most AI roles, it’s essential for modifying model architectures or building models from scratch. Most companies today leverage prebuilt models, so strong **application-level knowledge** is often sufficient.

Think of it like understanding how the web works vs. using the web to build online businesses. AI is now reaching a similar level of pervasiveness.

## Learning Roadmaps

### Long Learning Roadmap (80–100+ hours)
Recommended for a **deep understanding of LLMs**:

1. **Machine Learning** – Builds the foundation for deep learning  
   - *Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course*

2. **Deep Learning** – Essential for understanding neural networks  
   - *Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera*

3. **NLP Basics** – Covers RNNs, transformers, and attention  
   - *Stanford CS224N - NLP with Deep Learning*

4. **LLM Architecture and Training** – Covers large-scale model training and fine-tuning  
   - *Stanford CS25 - Transformers United*

5. **Building LLMs from the Ground Up** – A 3-hour coding workshop

> This path is recommended for those who want to understand LLMs **under the hood**.

### Shorter Learning Roadmap (2–3 hours)
For a **practical, application-level understanding** of LLMs and transformers:

- **Jay Alammar’s Illustrated Transformers** – Illustrated Transformer  
- **Andrej Karpathy’s Video on LLM Training** – *LLMs: Training & Fine-Tuning*  
- **Illustrating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** – From HuggingFace

> This shorter path won’t make you an ML or deep learning expert but gives a solid grasp of LLMs for practical use.
